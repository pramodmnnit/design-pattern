/**
 * Abstract Factory design pattern is one of the Creational patterns. Abstract Factory pattern is
 * almost similar to Factory Pattern except the fact that its more like factory of factories. If you
 * are familiar with factory design pattern in java, you will notice that we have a single Factory
 * class. This factory class returns different subclasses based on the input provided and factory
 * class uses if-else or switch statement to achieve this. In the Abstract Factory pattern, we get
 * rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each sub-class. Then an Abstract Factory class
 * that will return the sub-class based on the input factory class. At first, it seems confusing but
 * once you see the implementation, itâ€™s really easy to grasp and understand the minor difference
 * between Factory and Abstract Factory pattern.
