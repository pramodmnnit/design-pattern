/**
 * Command Pattern is one of the Behavioral Design Pattern. Command design pattern is used to
 * implement loose coupling in a request-response model. In command pattern, the request is send to
 * the invoker and invoker pass it to the encapsulated command object. Command object passes the
 * request to the appropriate method of Receiver to perform the specific action. The client program
 * create the receiver object and then attach it to the Command. Then it creates the invoker object
 * and attach the command object to perform an action. Now when client program executes the action,
 * itâ€™s processed based on the command and receiver object.
